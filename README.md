# template-site
A basic full-stack template site I am building using a basic WAMP setup with Laragon. 

To do:

x-Fix issue with Footer not properly staying out of Services body grid item

-Create php link to create a separate navbar file to later link to site on all pertinant pages

-Add OG Metas to the files and create thumbnail for Social Media cards

-Add Cookies and Cookie Disclaimer/Consent and Privacy Information prompts

-Add Form on Contact page with proper placeholders and information gathering prompts

-Add Calendly or some other possible online scheduling option for someone to request a meeting time immediately

x-Finish Services page, use JS and CSS to add sprinkle to the service options you will add

-Add 404 page for redirect
