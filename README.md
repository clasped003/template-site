# template-site
A basic full-stack template site I am building using a basic WAMP setup with Laragon. 

To do:
-Fix issue with Footer not properly staying out of Services body grid item
-Add Cookies and Cookie Disclaimer/Consent and Privacy Information prompts
-Add Form on Contact page with proper placeholders and information gathering prompts
-Add Calendly or some other possible online scheduling option for someone to request a meeting time immediately
-Finish Services page, use JS and CSS to add sprinkle to the service options you will add
